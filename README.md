# gnomopo
GNOme MOuse POsitioner is a Gnome Shell Extension that exposes the mouse position, as well as a python module that wraps communication with the extension in a function, getpos().

This is intended for vanilla/default (Wayland / Gnome Mutter) Ubuntu, which doesn't seem to have an easier way AFAICT.
